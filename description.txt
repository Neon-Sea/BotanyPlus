A collection of items and tweaks to make growing and gathering plants faster and more convenient

Features:
	Gaia Staff - An upgraded Staff of Regrowth that greatly increases drop rate of plants on harvest and instantly grows trees from planted saplings
	Growth and Spirit Lanterns - Increase the growth rate of plants within range. The Spirit variant has a stronger effect and also forces all nearby plants to always bloom when fully grown.
	Transmutation Table - An upgraded Alchemy Table that gives a 66% chance to conserve potion ingredients, and also acts as a water source

Changes:
	The Staff of Regrowth and Gaia Staff can be auto-selected when hovering over plants, will target plants while Smart Cursor is enabled, and automatically replant seeds in planter boxes and clay pots

This mod is a work-in-progress, contents are subject to change and further features may be added.

	Added seed replanting ability to vanilla Staff of Regrowth
	Made Gaia Staff match the Staff of Regrowth's speed when breaking plants
